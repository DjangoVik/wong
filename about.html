                  <p>Kahchun Wong is the Chief Conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra and the newly appointed Principal Guest Conductor of the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra. Praised by Musical America for the “depth and sincerity of his musicality”, he first came to international attention on winning First Prize at the Gustav Mahler Conducting Competition in 2016.</p>
                  <p>Highlights in 2021/2022 include notable debuts with the Detroit Symphony, Seattle Symphony and Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony, in addition to returning to the Bamberg Symphony, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Orquesta de Valencia and Tokyo Philharmonic in a specially curated gala featuring Toru Takemitsu’s early orchestral music.</p>
                  <p>Celebrated by the press for his debuts with the New York Philharmonic and Deutsche Radio Philharmonie Saarbrücken earlier in 2019, Wong has also recently appeared with Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse, Orchestre national d'Île-de-France, Japan Philharmonic, Osaka Philharmonic and Yomiuri Nippon Symphony during the 2020/2021 season.</p>
                  <p>A protégé of the late Kurt Masur, Wong had the privilege of sharing the podium with him on multiple occasions in his final years. He was appointed to the Dudamel Fellowship programme with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2016/17, and holds a Master of Music degree in orchestral/operatic conducting at the Hanns Eisler Musikhochschule in Berlin.</p>

                    <p>Wong believes in the power of music to inspire and uplift, mirroring his own journey as a musician from a young Southeast Asian country. In 2016, he co-founded Project Infinitude with Marina Mahler, the granddaughter of Gustav Mahler. Over the next few years, he worked closely with Child at Street 11, a non-profit Singaporean agency to support more than 100 children from underserved and diverse backgrounds. In 2019, together with BR-Klassik and Stadtsparkasse Nürnberg, he conceptualised and led PACHELBEL.VIER.NULL, a collaborative TV project which raised donations for Sternstunden e.V., a non-profit association for children in Germany. During the 2020 pandemic, he convened over 1000 international musicians for a digital sing-along of Beethoven's Ode to Joy for ChildAid, an annual charity event in Singapore which raised close to 2 million dollars for the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund and the Business Times Budding Artists Fund.</p>
                    <p>In December 2019 at only the age of 33, Wong became the first artist from Singapore to be conferred the Order of Merit by the Federal President of Germany for his dedicated service and outstanding achievements in Singaporean-German cultural relations and the advancement of German music culture abroad..</p>

                    <h3>Inclusive community</h3>
                    <p>In Southeast Asia, classical music is gaining popularity. Through arts and culture, there is huge potential for people-to-people interaction and understanding.</p>
                    <p>Coming from a non-musical, working class family background, Kahchun was asked by his mathematics teacher to join the school brass band at the age of 7, to cover the shortage of cornet players. This pivotal event turned out to be life-changing for him.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by how his own music journey started by chance, Kahchun co-founded project infinitude with Marina Mahler, the granddaughter of the composer Gustav Mahler. Its pilot edition in 2016 was generously underwritten by Marina, allowing it to grow sustainably and now taking on a new life in Singapore.</p>
                    <p>An inclusive movement for children, his vision is to nurture a whole generation of music lovers who listen to the beauty in art, in addition to other unique and diverse voices in our shared community. He wants to encourage children from all walks of life to believe that they deserve to enjoy music, regardless of their background.</p>

                    <p>In 2017, Kahchun invited 6-year old children to his rehearsals with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, and in return, they taught him how to dance the flamenco. They are students of Child at Street 11, non-profit child development centre committed to creating opportunities and building brighter futures for less privileged children.</p>
                    <p>Building on the trust that has been built between conductor and child, he has made it a priority to return to Singapore when possible, to spend meaningful time at Child at Street 11.</p>
                    <p>Kahchun also believes that music inculcates cognitive and psychological life skills in young people. Now into its third year, project infinitude’s curriculum has been crafted through a series of intensive dialogue between Kahchun and the children themselves, alongside their guardians, teachers and community leaders. Additional support has come from the President of the Mahler Foundation Marina Mahler, Founding Director of Child at Street 11 Nirmala Murugaian, retired Assistant High Commissioner of the United Nations Janet Lim and renowned Singaporean storyteller and pedagogue Rosemarie Somaiah.</p>
